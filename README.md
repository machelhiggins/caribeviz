# CaribEViz
This is a fork of Ergo (https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/bitbucket/scm/ergo/ergo.git) developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne. 
Most of the developement occurred at the University of the West Indies, Seismic Research Center (UWI, SRC) under the the UWI, Institute for Sustainable Development executed Enhancing Knowledge and Application of Comprehensive Disaster Manager Initiative (EKACDM). The software has been used to estimate, in a medium to high-resolution scale, the seismic risk of the Kingston Metropolitan Area and Portmore, Jamaica, Barbados, and Dominica.
Ergo is an open source implementation of HAZUS. CaribEViz was developed to work with building footprints, data sets common to most CSOs of island-states under the remit or adjacent to UWI, and local expert knowledge to produce building structural classifcation. Analysese that have been validate are:  
1. Building Structure and Occupancy Type\Rate Classification
2. Building Structural Damage
3. Direct Econoic Loss
4. UWI Dislocated Population (using the EKACDM methodology)
5. UWI Casualities (using the EKACDM methodology)
6. Shelter Post-Earthquake Capacity
7. Healthcare Facility Post-Earthquake Capacity
A manuscript is being prepared for Natural Hazards that will describe the methodologies implemented in CaribEViz.
Ergo will soon be moved

The software and any resulting analyses is offered as is. CaribEViz is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
